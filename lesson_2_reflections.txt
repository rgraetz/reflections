What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
creates background files necessary to track file changes

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area contains files that will be committed in future. With staging area you can select which files you want to put in a commit, instead of committing all changes files in the working directory.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Control what is put in staging area and compare staging area with last commit to ensure it is only one logical change that is being committed.
